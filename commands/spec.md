# Create Specification

I'll help you create a specification for **$1**.

## Process

1. Analyzing project structure to understand conventions
2. Presenting specification template options:
   - **Feature Specification** (default) - For new features
   - **API Specification** - For REST/GraphQL endpoints
   - **Component Specification** - For UI components
   - **Architecture Specification** - For system design

3. Guiding through SDL (Spec Definition Language) format
4. Validating completeness before saving
5. Saving to `docs/specs/SPEC-[ID].md`
6. Creating initial state.json entry

Which template would you like to use? (Or press Enter for Feature Specification)
