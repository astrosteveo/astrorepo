# Implement from Specification

Starting implementation of **$1**...

## Implementation Workflow

### Phase Check
Verifying prerequisites:
- [ ] Specification approved
- [ ] Architecture plan exists
- [ ] Tests generated

### TodoWrite Task Breakdown
Creating task list from implementation plan...

### TDD Workflow
Following test-driven development:
1. Run tests (expect failures)
2. Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Checkpoint after each step
5. Auto-invoke debugger on failures
6. Max 5 iterations before human escalation

### Continuous Validation
- Running tests after each change
- Updating state.json with progress
- Tracking test_pass_rate metric
