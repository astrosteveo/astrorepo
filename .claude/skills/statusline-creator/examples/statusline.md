description: Create or customize a Claude Code statusline
---

Help me create a beautiful, functional statusline for Claude Code.

Use the statusline-creator skill to:
1. Ask about my preferences (minimal vs. full-featured, what info to show, color preferences)
2. Recommend an approach (template vs. custom)
3. Create and install the statusline
4. Explain how to further customize it

Focus on creating something that matches my workflow and aesthetic preferences.

## Installation

To use this slash command, copy this file to your Claude Code commands directory:

```bash
cp examples/statusline.md ~/.claude/commands/statusline.md
```

Then you can invoke it in Claude Code with:

```
/statusline
```

This will launch an interactive statusline creation session using the statusline-creator skill.
